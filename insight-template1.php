        <p class="director-small">Collab Collective is a learning Social Enterprise / Movement that  was started with the core purpose of connecting the dots to enable shared positive outcomes including productivity and financial for organisations.
Collab Collective is a powerful network to help facilitate change along with critical and diverse thinking within your organisation. Through an exploration of new ideas, we link industry and not-for-profits to change the world and make a difference. IIt is important that not-for-profits are able to engage with their current community so through purpose and outcomes driven support, Collab Collective offers services which strive for shared knowledge to enable growth, current skill enhancement, and critical thinking through experience. 
<br>
<br>
Collab Collective assists not-for-profits, through a link with industry, as they move towards a focus on self-sufficiency and social enterprise meaning they do not have to lose focus of their core purpose. We do this by enabling and facilitating interaction between diverse sectors to help facilitate change along with critical and diverse thinking within our Non-for Profit, Industry Groups and Small Business Sectors.  
<br><br>Through teamwork, critical thinking, and problem solving, Collaborate and Conquer is a community where these principles can be lived in action. </p>
